# Self-Aware Computation Example
#
# This demonstrates how EigenScript programs can:
# 1. Interrogate their own execution state
# 2. Modify their behavior based on self-knowledge
# 3. Achieve stable self-reference without infinite regress
#
# All through the fundamental invariant I = (A-B)²

# Example 1: Adaptive Algorithm
# The function interrogates its process quality and adapts
define adaptive_search as:
    # Initial computation
    result is n * 2

    # Self-interrogate: How well am I performing?
    quality is how is result

    # Self-modify based on quality assessment
    if oscillating:
        # Detected paradox/cycle - use simplified approach
        return n
    else:
        if improving:
            # Converging well - continue with complex method
            return result * result
        else:
            # Plateau - try alternative
            return result + n

# Example 2: Self-Monitoring Loop
# The loop observes its own convergence and adapts
define self_monitoring_iterate as:
    state is n
    counter is 0

    loop while counter < 100:
        counter is counter + 1

        # Self-interrogate trajectory
        direction is why is state
        temporal is when is state

        # Self-modify based on geometric state
        if converged:
            # Reached eigenstate - return early
            return state

        if diverging:
            # Moving away from solution - reverse direction
            state is state - 1
        else:
            # Approaching solution - continue
            state is state + 1

    return state

# Example 3: Meta-Circular Self-Reference
# The function can safely observe itself observing itself
define self_observer as:
    # First level: observe input
    magnitude is what is n

    # Second level: observe the observation
    identity is who is magnitude

    # Third level: observe the observer (stable due to lightlike OF)
    meta is self_observer of self_observer

    # Returns eigenstate at lightlike boundary
    return meta

# Example 4: Debugging Through Self-Interrogation
# Instead of print statements, query geometric state directly
define complex_computation as:
    temp is n * 3

    # Self-interrogate for debugging
    if not stable:
        # System unstable - log state
        debug_value is what is temp
        debug_where is where is temp
        debug_when is when is temp
        debug_why is why is temp
        debug_how is how is temp

        # Can examine all geometric properties without explicit tracking

    result is temp + 5

    # Self-assess before returning
    if converged:
        return result
    else:
        # Need more iterations
        return complex_computation of result

# Example 5: Self-Modifying Control Flow
# Behavior changes based on interrogated execution state
define dynamic_branching as:
    x is n

    # Query current state
    current_state is how is x

    # Branch based on geometric properties (not just values)
    if stable:
        # In stable regime - use fast method
        return x * 2
    else:
        if diverging:
            # Exploring space - use conservative method
            return x + 1
        else:
            if equilibrium:
                # At phase boundary - special handling
                return x
            else:
                # Default case
                return x - 1

# Example 6: Self-Aware Recursion
# Function monitors its own recursion depth and adjusts
define depth_aware_factorial as:
    # Check recursion depth
    depth is when is n

    # Base case (standard)
    if n < 2:
        return 1

    # But also self-modify based on depth
    if depth > 10:
        # Deep recursion detected - switch to iterative
        result is 1
        counter is n
        loop while counter > 1:
            result is result * counter
            counter is counter - 1
        return result
    else:
        # Shallow recursion - continue recursively
        prev is n - 1
        sub is depth_aware_factorial of prev
        return n * sub

# The key insight: All self-interrogation reduces to I = (A-B)²
# - Current state A
# - Previous state B
# - Self-knowledge: r, κ, FS, S²-C² computed from I
#
# There's no special "reflection" layer - introspection is just
# another geometric operation. The program interrogating itself
# uses the same math as computing values.
#
# Metacognition emerges naturally when self-reference is stable.
