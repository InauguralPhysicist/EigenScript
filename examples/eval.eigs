define eval_add as:
    left is n
    right is m
    result is left + right
    return result

define eval_mul as:
    left is n  
    right is m
    result is left * right
    return result

n is 3
m is 4
sum_result is eval_add of n
print of sum_result

n is 5
m is 6
prod_result is eval_mul of n
print of prod_result

print of fs
print of signature
